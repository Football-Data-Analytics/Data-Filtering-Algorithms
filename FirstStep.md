# Page 1: First filters

To start the analysis of the players, the first step is to discard the players whose probability of not being useful is above 85-90%.

On this page there are filters that will separate the players who are most likely not going to make any profit.


## Filters

 - Excluding **injured** and **suspended** players
 - Excluding the players who have been **on the bench** for the last **13 games** in the previous **15 games**
 - Excluding out players who have a lot of **same position players** in their team ( More details later )
 - Separation of players based on position into four categories: **goalkeepers**, **defenders**, **midfielders**, and **forwards**
